<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<h3 id="clean-rom">Provide a ROM</h2>
<p>First things first, you'll need to provide a clean copy of a headered, USA version Super Mario World ROM renamed to '<b>clean.smc</b>' (take care to ensure the file extension* is <code>.smc</code> and not <code>.sfc</code>). Place this file in the "resources" folder.</p>
<p>If you have forgot this step the build tool will prompt you about it.</p>
<small>*this may require you to turn on extensions in Windows' File Explorer.</small>
<h3 id="initialize-the-baserom">Initialize the Baserom</h3>
<p>To start using the baserom you will first have to initialize the project as it comes without any of the tools bundled.</p>
<p>You can do this by running the provided PowerShell script: <code>!initialize_baserom.ps1</code>. This can be done in Windows by either right clicking on it and choosing "Run" or executing it from a Terminal or the Command Line.</p>
<p> When you run it, a new command line window will appear and prompt you with the following menu. Both actions are required.</p>
<pre>
------------------------------
Initialize Baserom

What would you like to to?

1. Download and Setup all Baserom Tools
2. Run first build of the Baserom
0. Exit

Enter the number of your choice:
</pre>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>The "Download and Setup all Baserom Tools" action will check for all of the tools required by the baserom, and download them on demand. This is done to keep the baserom pretty lean and avoid distributing a lot of executables and binary files.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>The "Run first build of the Baserom" action will build the baserom from scratch using Callisto so you can get right to hacking on your project.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-baserom">Building the Baserom</h3>
<p>This baserom comes with a build tool called "Callisto" that will perform all actions needed to build and update your hack everytime you want to make changes. It executes all the common tools behind the scenes with a single command. Callisto will also monitor your project and export changes to keep things up-to-date (provided you are using it's <b>Edit</b> functionality).</p>

<p>If everything has been set-up correctly, Callisto will build the baserom in its entirety to be ready for use. See the Callisto readmes in the <b>docs</b> folder for more information.</p>
