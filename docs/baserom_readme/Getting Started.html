<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<h3 id="clean-rom">Provide a ROM</h2>
<p>First things first, you'll need to provide a clean copy of a headered, USA version Super Mario World ROM renamed to 'clean.smc' (take care to ensure the file extension* is <code>.smc</code> and not <code>.sfc</code>). Place this file in the "workspace" folder.</p>
<small>*this may require you to turn on extensions in Windows' File Explorer.</small>
<h3 id="initialize-the-baserom">Initialize the Baserom</h3>
<p>To start using the baserom you will first have to initialize the project. You can do this by running the provided PowerShell script: <code>!initialize_baserom.ps1</code>. When you run this script it will prompt you with some options:</p>
<pre>
1. Download and Setup all Baserom Tools
2. Restore Baserom list files.
3. Setup Baserom's custom Lunar Magic toolbar.
0. Exit
</pre>
<p>The only required step is: <code>Download and Setup all Baserom Tools</code>. Running this will check for all of the tools required by the baserom, and download them on demand. This is done to keep the baserom pretty lean and avoid distributing a lot of executables and binary files.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-baserom">Building the Baserom</h3>
<p>To make life easier for you as a hacker, this baserom comes with a build tool called Callisto that will run all the tools needed to build and update your hack everytime you want to make changes to it It will also monitor your project to keep things up-to-date. You can find it by running <code>callisto.exe</code> in the "callisto" folder.</p>
<p>See the Callisto readmes in the docs folder for more information.</p>
