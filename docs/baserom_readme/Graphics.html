<h3 id="alt-exgfx">Alternate ExGraphic</h3>
<p>Lunar Magic supports a special sort of ExGraphic called "Alternate ExGFX" which is used for ExAnimation to store frames that are globally available in the ROM (opposed to slot AN2, which is per-level) these are limited to ExGFX60-63</p>
<h4>ExGFX61: Global ExAnimation</h4>
<p>In the baserom the <code>ExGFX61</code> resource contains all global animation frames, for ON/OFF tiles, one-Ways, the sprite note block, etc. See the <a href="ExAnimation.html">Exanimation</a> page for more details on how they're used. However there are some extra frames available for additional use.</p>
