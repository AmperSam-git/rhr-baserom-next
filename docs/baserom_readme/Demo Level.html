<h2>Demo Level</h2>
<p>The baserom has a demonstration level inserted into level <code>105</code> (which is normally "Yoshi's Island 1" but that has been moved to the unused level <code>112</code>) so it's seen right when you open Lunar Magic.</p>
<p>The demo level is provided to present the custom blocks included in the baserom, complete with a legend, and give short bits of advice for constructing your level.</p>
<p>You can see an image capture of the level below but it is also accessible on the Overworld on a path that goes up from Yoshi's House so you can try it for yourself.</p>
