<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="callisto">"What is Callisto?"</h3>
<p>It's a build tool that manages your project and does all the usual romhacking things through a simple user interface with a few actions. Callisto designed to run tools only when needed and avoid potential conflicts between resources, this way it insures your hack is cleanly constructed whenever you make changes. The big upside of using this is if something goes wrong then you can easily pinpoint what that was and remove or fix it so the next time you build it is not included in your project.</p>
<p>See the Callisto readmes in the <a href="../">docs</a> folder for more details information about how to use this tool.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="build-scripts">"What happened to the build scripts?"</h3>
<p>In an effort to keep the baserom lean, we're going all-in on the Callisto build tool. The build batch files, while useful, were also a bit of maintainance burden and didn't work for some people.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="removing-things">"How do I remove things from the baserom?"</h3>
<p>Callisto makes it easy to remove items from the baserom without a problem as it re-builds your ROM from scratch avoiding resource conflicts. Removing resources, like blocks or sprites, is as straightforward as editing the list of the respective tool, or removing things from the "resources.toml" in the buildtool folder and running the <code>Update</code> action. Afterwards you can then delete those resources, if desired.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="hide-statusbar">"How do I hide the status bar?"</h3>
This baserom comes with several objects to toggle features in levels, including the status bar. Check out the <a href="UberASM Objects.html">UberASM Objects</a> documentation for details.
<hr>
<h3 id="fast-retry">"Does this have Fast Retry?"</h3>
<p>Yes! By default the baserom is configured to be "vanilla" but you can turn on the retry in a level using a custom object. The <a href="UberASM Objects.html#retry-objects">UberASM Objects</a> has a section for the retry system with details. Otherwise you can make hack-wide changes to the retry system, by editing its config files in <code>tools/uberasmtool/retry_config</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="block-graphics">"Why are my block graphics not looking right?"</h3>
<center><img src="img/garbled_map16.png" title="Custom block tiles missing ExGraphics"></center>
<p>Many of the custom global block in the baserom use ExGraphics, loading <code>E17</code> into the <b>FG2</b> slot in the Super GFX Bypass dialog will make the blocks appear as they are intended to in other levels.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="sa1">"Is the baserom SA-1 compatible?"</h3>
<p>Yes! The baserom's resources are all compatible with SA-1, but the baserom itself is configured to be FastROM by default. However to use SA-1 it only takes a couple steps to switch over to it:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the "project.toml" file in the <b>buildtool</b> folder, change the <code>initial_patch</code> setting to use the SA-1 option.</li>
<li>Rebuild your project in Callisto to make the change.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<!-- <h3 id="script-cannot-run">"Why can't I run the initialization script?"</h3>
<p>This is due to something in Windows called <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies">Execution Policies</a> which is a security and safety feature to prevent the execution of malicious scripts, by preventing any script from being run at all (among other things).</p>
<p>You can however change the Execution Policy to something more permissive to allow you to run scripts on your computer. To do this launch PowerShell with the <b>Run as administrator</b> option, type or paste the following, and hit Enter.</p>
<pre>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</pre>
<p>Now you should be able to run the initialization script. When you are all finished you can set it back to the default for your computer.</p>
<pre>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Default</pre>
