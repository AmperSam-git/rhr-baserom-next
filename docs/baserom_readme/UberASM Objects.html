<h2>UberASM objects</h2>
<p>The baserom uses a framework of custom objects to allow you to toggle or activate some UberASM features that are in the baserom. This are activated simply by inserting a custom extension object into whichever levels you want.</p>
<h3 id="inserting-objects">Inserting Objects</h3>
<p>To insert a custom object either use the "Edit > Insert manual..." menu action or press the <code>Insert</code> key while in Lunar Magic's Object editing mode.</p>
<p>Multiple custom UberASM objects can be active in one level and they can be inserted one at time by putting its value in the <b>Size/Type/Ext (0-FF)</b> field.</p>

<p>When inserted, custom objects will look garbled in Lunar Magic since they load a "null" object but they won't actually appear in game. The tiles they are made up of may occasionally use an exit-enabled (door) tile which may display a warning depending on your Lunar Magic settings.</p>
