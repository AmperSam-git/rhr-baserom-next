This is a list of advanced topics when it comes to Callisto. These are not necessarily complicated or hard to understand (I hope!), but are simply not strictly necessary for using Callisto and have thus been collected here. While you can try reading them in any order, I would recommend going from top to bottom since some chapter should ideally be read in order, but don't let that stop you from checking something out if it sounds interesting! Happy hacking!
