Through a variety of patches some vanilla sprites now have new features that can be enabled by setting the extra bit of each:

1. You can place a disco shell if you set the extra bit on any of the shell sprites.

- Shells (Sprites DA,DB,DC, DD, DF)
    Extra bit = 0: normal
    Extra bit = 1: disco shell

2. You can spawn a kicked shell of a corresponding variety by setting the extra bit on the Koopa, Parakoopa or Buzzy Beetle sprites.

- Koopas (Sprites 04-07)
    Extra bit = 0: normal
    Extra bit = 1: kicked shell of same color

- Green Parakoopa (sprites 08, 09)
    Extra bit = 0: normal
    Extra bit = 1: kicked double bounce shell

- Buzzy Beetle (sprite 11)
    Extra bit = 0: normal
    Extra bit = 1: kicked buzzy shell

3. You can now place a throw block in levels without picking one up, with the extra bit clear it will spawn in the stationary state, if set it will spawn kicked towards Mario. 

- Throw Block (sprite 53)
    Extra bit = 0: normal, stationary
    Extra bit = 1: kicked

4. Setting the extra bit on three rotating gray platforms sprite will spawn it as a triple ball 'n' chain.

- 3 Platforms on Chains (sprite E0)
    Extra bit = 0: normal, grey platforms
    Extra bit = 1: spike ball

5. Yoshi's island submap-specific behavior has been removed from Monty Moles, Hammer Bros and Dry Bones, which can be re-enabled by setting the extra bit

- Monty Moles (sprites 4D,4E)
    Extra bit = 0: fast digging
    Extra bit = 1: slow digging

- Hammer Bro (sprite 9B)
    Extra bit = 0: unfrequent throwing
    Extra bit = 1: frequent throwing

- Dry Bones, stay on ledge (sprite 32)
    Extra bit = 0: throws bones
    Extra bit = 1: doesn't throw bones
